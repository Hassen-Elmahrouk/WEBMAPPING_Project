# Project Name

## Web Mapping Application with OpenLayers

### Project Description

Web mapping is the process of designing, implementing, and deploying web applications that utilize spatial data. There are various JavaScript APIs available for building web mapping applications, and when combined with other web technologies such as HTML5, Bootstrap, jQuery, etc., you can create highly robust and performant applications. OpenLayers stands out as a powerful open-source JavaScript API for web mapping development, supported by a vibrant community. This project involves building a web mapping application from scratch using OpenLayers.

### Technologies Used

- OpenLayers
- GeoServer
- PostgreSQL
- Node.js
- JavaScript (JS)
- HTML
- CSS

### Getting Started

To initiate the project, follow these steps:

1. **Create a PostgreSQL Database Table:**
   - Create a table in a PostgreSQL database. Example:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE mytable (
       id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       shape_type VARCHAR,
       geometry GEOMETRY
     );
     ```

2. **Start Node.js Server:**
   - Navigate to the 'js' directory:
     ```bash
     cd js
     ```
   - Run the Node.js server responsible for intercepting requests and saving data to the database:
     ```bash
     node api.js
     ```

3. **Launch GeoServer:**
   - Start the GeoServer by navigating to the GeoServer home directory and running:
     ```bash
     %GEOSERVER_HOME%\bin\startup
     ```

4. **Publish Layers from GeoServer:**
   - After launching GeoServer, publish the layers needed for your web mapping application.
